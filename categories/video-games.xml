After getting used to the controls the game plays smoothly enough with some practice. Controls aside this is a solid Zelda game with everything I've come to expect from this series. It did feel a bit on the easier side though as far as bosses went, and I attribute that to the stylus controls, not that they made it easier, but the designers had to tone down the fights due to the somewhat janky and slower nature of using the stylus compared to a dpad and buttons.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>DS</category><category>review</category><category>video games</category><guid>https://www.modelhumanprocessor.com/posts/the-legend-of-zelda-phantom-houseglassds/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 00:42:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
