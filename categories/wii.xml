The controls are fun when they work correctly, but when they get flaky and on some of the later stages where proper timing is very narrow the controls can be infuriating. The puzzles themselves are great, but when you get hampered in solving them not because you can't figure out the next step, but because the fussy motion controls not working as intended it really detracts from the enjoyment. Which is too bad, because when the controls did work they felt great, and would really match up the feeling of whatever action was being performed, unfortuently the controls became so frustrating for me during the final stage that I just gave up and watched the ending on youtube and offloaded the disc to my local games store. As for the story, there are pirates, a magic monkey, and ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>review</category><category>video game</category><category>wii</category><guid>https://www.modelhumanprocessor.com/posts/zack-and-wiki/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:52:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
