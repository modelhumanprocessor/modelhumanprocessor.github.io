                    <p>A Gameboy Advance remake of the classic NES game and another NES game that wasn't originally released outside Japan. This was also released on the Playstation. Although there are differences between each console version. The GBA version is rather easier than the original and has some optional dungeons for FF1. FF1 was probably my introduction to the whole genre, and there's way too much nostalgia that bias' my views on the game itself.
As for FF2, this was the first time playing it. There is an interesting story system with the use of keywords to progress certain story events and the playable cast is named, with temporary members coming and going throughout the course of the story which gives the game a lot more depth than the first game. The combat system is similar in how battles take place, but the leveling system is completely different. And although the leveling system is interesting in principle, where various stats and skills go up with use instead of via a more traditional experience point value, it lends itself to meta gaming and power leveling performing very unnatural things in order to level faster, such as equipping two shields, or attacking your own party members. All of which can be done fairly early in the game to gain a massive advantage that can trivialize much of the games content. There is also an optional dungeon at the end that brings back in the temporary party members for their own bonus adventure that was not in the original version of the game.</p>

                    <p>I never had the chance to own a Nintendo 64 console when they were current, so when I saw this remake/port for the DS I snapped it up, never having had a chance to fully play through the original N64 version. The DS version is pretty faithful although adds some new features and mini games, the controls could be a bit clunky at times, although I recall the N64 controls also having a few awkward moments but it still works and is very playable. This game is pretty classic as it marked the first shift from 2d platformers into 3d and set the stage for the Mario Galaxy games on the Wii, and Mario Obyssey on Switch. The only time the controls and particularly the camera controls frustrated me was during the final boss, although part of that is just me being bad at getting the timing of the throw correct. I only went for 80/150 stars, which many fans would consider sacriligious. But I'd rather move on to other games or save doing a full star run for the non-handheld version.</p>

                    <p>Although the original game was released for Playstation in July 2000 and was a tactical rpg, the DS remake in 2008 switches the combat to be a more standard turn based jrpg. Some content was also taken out from the post game. It is very much a beginner jrpg, with a hint of where to go next in the status screen so even if you take an extended break you won't be totally lost of where you left off. Not  that many breaks are needed, the game itself is fairly short even when you complete the side stories to recruit more puppets. Speaking the side stories, it is possible to miss out on some of them if you advance  the story too far before completeing the side quests which is always a disappointment for me. The story is cute and an inversion of the more standard fantasy rpg story. The combat system is decent enough if a little basic, and although there's a fairly high encounter rate you can enable auto battle to sweep through the low difficulty mobs and enter manual commnds for bosses or as needed.</p>

                    <p>A cute puzzle game released in 2001, and 2004 respectively for the Nintendo GameCube. Collect parts of your crashed ship with the help of cute flower creatures. Things start off great, but as the games progress the way the 'difficulty' ramps up is by means of making the levels larger and require more moving around navigating the pikmin to different areas. Which after the midpoint or so started to wear thin and be more tedious than anything else. Fun at first, the sound and music in particular, but just couldn't carry me through the entirity of either game.</p>

                    <p>The original classic Zelda game that started it all. Although I first played through this game years ago I was feeling nostalgic and played it again. Although I did cheat by using a walkthrough to get through it quickly without searching every nook and crany for the secret locations I could no longer remember. The nostalgia was strong though and the game still felt enjoyable to play even after so many years. I didn't bother with the new game+ mode where everything is moved around and  the difficulty is higher, maybe one day.</p>

                    <p>Released in Oct 2007 for the Nintendo Wii, this is a cute puzzle game that makes use of the wiimote motion controls for solving each stage puzzles. The controls are fun when they work correctly, but when they get flaky and on some of the later stages where proper timing is very narrow the controls can be infuriating. The puzzles themselves are great, but when you get hampered in solving them not because you can't figure out the next step, but because the fussy motion controls not working as intended it really detracts from the enjoyment. Which is too bad, because when the controls did work they felt great, and would really match up the feeling of whatever action was being performed, unfortuently the controls became so frustrating for me during the final stage that I just gave up and watched the ending on youtube and offloaded the disc to my local games store. As for the story, there are pirates, a magic monkey, and ghosts.</p>

                    <p>Here's a series that probably could have done with ending. Or maybe whatever nostalgia I had for the ps2 trilogy had all vanished by the time I got around to playing this follow up originally released in Feb. 2008, I probably didn't play this until 2016. I found Nero's over the top emo whining and Dante's too cool for school attitude both to be tiresome. The game itself probably would have been more enjoyable at a higher difficulty setting where proper use of the combat system combos was more required, but at the normal setting it a fairly mindless hack and slash of pushing the attack buttons performing whatever random combo seemed appropriate unless the boss or monster required something more specific. Probably not a franchise I'd continue to play after this.</p>

                    <p>Originally released on XBox 360 way back in Oct. 2012. I had played the first two games closer to their release dates after having this one sit on the shelf for nearly 5 years I finally got around to playing it.
I enjoyed the intro plot twist of the prologue, but once into the game itself, I found the mini games of hunting, naval battles, trading, and crafting to be largely pointless as the game could easily be completed without them. The village building part was ok as it fleshed out some characters, I never finished the naval battle content and ended up just watching some clips of that side story on youtube.
In terms of the story it really wraps up all the threads being teased in the first two games with the precurser civilization, the templars, and Mile's roll in all of it. And closes out the trilogy, or at least it probably could and maybe even should have. There's a lot more titles in  this franchise and I'm not sure how they're going to keep it going story wise after what happened at the end of this one.
It was a little dismaying to see the bonus season pass content being offered up as DLC for $25 (at the time I was playing anyways) it seemed a bit much for a few side story scenarios. So I passed on those, if I was curious enough about any cutscenes or story aspect I could probably find them on youtube.
Overall a satisfying end point, it makes me a bit worried for even trying any subsequent games that it might just turn into ubisoft milking it instead of moving on to new ideas.</p>

                    <p>So github has this handy setting for github pages that will redirct your repo's or user's github.io page to some other server. But my dumb ass misread that and thought it was a setting to point my custom hostname at the github page and like, it needed to know what url was going to be redirecting to it for permissions or some such. But no it was a CNAME redirect.. meaning that when I went to my domain registar and pointed my custom domain at the github.io url I created a loop.I need to find some good books on that stuff at some point.</p>
