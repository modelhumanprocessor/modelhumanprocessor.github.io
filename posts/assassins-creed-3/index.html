    <p>Originally released on XBox 360 way back in Oct. 2012. I had played the first two games closer to their release dates after having this one sit on the shelf for nearly 5 years I finally got around to playing it.
I enjoyed the intro plot twist of the prologue, but once into the game itself, I found the mini games of hunting, naval battles, trading, and crafting to be largely pointless as the game could easily be completed without them. The village building part was ok as it fleshed out some characters, I never finished the naval battle content and ended up just watching some clips of that side story on youtube.
In terms of the story it really wraps up all the threads being teased in the first two games with the precurser civilization, the templars, and Mile's roll in all of it. And closes out the trilogy, or at least it probably could and maybe even should have. There's a lot more titles in  this franchise and I'm not sure how they're going to keep it going story wise after what happened at the end of this one.
It was a little dismaying to see the bonus season pass content being offered up as DLC for $25 (at the time I was playing anyways) it seemed a bit much for a few side story scenarios. So I passed on those, if I was curious enough about any cutscenes or story aspect I could probably find them on youtube.
Overall a satisfying end point, it makes me a bit worried for even trying any subsequent games that it might just turn into ubisoft milking it instead of moving on to new ideas.</p>
