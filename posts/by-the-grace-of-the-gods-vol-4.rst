.. type: text

The (mostly) slow life continues. Despite the continued interference of jealous rival tamers the business ventures of Ryoma continue to do well, so well that he is expanding into another town. There is some other developments with Ryoma starting to make preparations to raise his adventurer rank in order to claim the inheritance of his adopted grandparents. But that will have to be in later volumes. There were a few minor additions from the WN version in this volume, but nothing really of note.
