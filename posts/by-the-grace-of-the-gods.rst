.. description: Review for By the Grace of the Gods LN
.. type: text

A rather traditional 'isekai' story. The protagonist is an unfortunate office worker reincarnated with the skills acquired while he was alive plus some extra gifted skills like the requiset magic. In the first volume he reincarnates, proceeds to live a 'slow life' in the woods for awhile, until meeting a noble and his guards, then moving to the nearby town, becoming an adventurer, etc. The kind of standard fare you'd expect from a fantasy isekai. 
Volume 2 continues the story where the protagonist takes a break from adventuring to work some side hustles alongside his adventure guild tasks. 
Volume 3 has his side job in full swing, and ends with parting with the noble family that had been central to him coming into town in the first place. Which if I remember correctly from when I read the web novel version this more or less wraps up the first major arc. 
It's a fairly solid slice of life isekai if that's what you're into. There's no grand quest for him to slay the demon lord or save the world. There is some side plots with a bit of intrigue here and there, and the standard way that reincarnators stir up various kinds of trouble and attention that keep the story moving along.
