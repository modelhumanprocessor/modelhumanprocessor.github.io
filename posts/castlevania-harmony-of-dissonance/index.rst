.. description: Castlevania Harmony of Dissonance (GBA) review
.. type: text

A very Symphony of the Night style castlevania game for Gameboy Advance where you play as Juste Belmont. It has all the elements you'd expect from a SoTN style action rpg, but nothing in partiuclar that makes it stand out. Overall a fun game to play if you enjoy the series and style of gameplay.
