.. description: Castlevania Portrait of Ruin(DS) Review
.. type: text

Another solid metroid vania symphony of the night style game. There's some new systems in places with mini quests, sub weapon skill system, but the quest system has a flaw where it's possible to sell a few of the items required for a quest by mistake and have no way to get them again to finish the quest. Which happened to me and was very frustrating as I was working on completeing as much of the content as possible but didn't want to have to restart. The partner switching feature was interesting, and needed for a few puzzles, but could also be a little clunky at times. Having to equip spells make switching cumbersome so a lot of them will go to waste, the same with the large number of sub weapons available. There's probably some appeal to them for people who really want 100% clear and maxed out and that will extend the total play time, but for a casual playthrough, they're wasted or gimmicky. There's some extra modes typical of castlevania, although they're fairly short, add some replayability, but I'd had enough after finishing the primary story.
