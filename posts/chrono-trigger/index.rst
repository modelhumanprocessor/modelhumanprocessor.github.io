.. description: Chrono Trigger (DS) Review
.. type: text

The classic SNES JRPG ported to the Nintendo DS. This replaces the practically unplayable Playstation port. It includes some new bonus side quest areas that get unlocked in the new game+ as well as a new ending, otherwise it's a faithful port of the original. And the DS is actually well suited to SNES ports aside from being on a small screen. When playing the SNES version, this was the first rpg I recall playing that had multiple endings that changed based on certain actions taken during the game, or at what point you opt to face  the final boss during a replay.
