.. description: Review for Final Fantasy III (DS)
.. type: text

Another port of an NES game that never made it out of Japan. I barely remember the story outside of 'save the world' due to playing the first 2/3 of the game, taking a fairly long break, then finishing the game after all the primary plot points had been covered and just returning to beat the final couple dungeons. I vaguely recall the story being engaging enough when I started though. 
The big change in this game compared to earlier ones is the job change system. You unlock various jobs as you progress through the game, can change a character's job at save points or in the field, and each job levels up separately by accululating job points during combat. Which is distinct from the experience points gained. Although this gives completely freedom in building any kind of team you desire, and each job gets a little mini quest for some top tier equipment once it reaches level 99, the actual process or leveling jobs once again encourages an unnatural playstyle and grinding. Instead of just fighting monsters normally, you want to take as many actions/turns on each character in order to gain a job level, which is capped at one per battle. And since switching to a new job weakens your character to a certain degree, you are further incentivized to return to the starting area to grind job levels without gaining regular levels, since the level up bonuses will are somewhat tied to the characters current job level. And despite the huge pool of ~26 jobs there are only a small handful of fights that actively require a specific job to be present(only 3 iirc, scholar, dragoon, dark knight) in order to deal with a boss mechanic, most of the jobs never really get a chance to shine especially when combined with the annoyances of levelling them with the penalty applied each time to change them.
Overall though I'm glad I finally got to play and finish one of the previously missing mainline Final Fantasy titles and see where most of the jobs that would appear in later titles first appeared.
