.. description: Final Fantasy IV(DS) Review
.. type: text

a 3D remake of the classic SNES title with the original(JP) higher difficulty mitigated somewhat by the augment system that grant extra abilities. The augment system is interesting, but taking full advantage of it almost necessitates the use of a guide that details how each augment is obtained. The game contains some cutscenes with voice acting, which is a nice touch. I've started this game multiple times on different consoles, and playing this version was quite the change with the difficulty increase. Bosses I remembered just steamrolling with autoattacks required actual strategy to beat which gave the game a suitable level of challenge and kept each boss interesting. The new game+ feature is there, which combined with the augments allows the game to be cleared pretty quickly and gives some replay value, but if you're trying to min max a guide is required. I didn't bother due to missing some augments as well as missing 0.1% of the map somewhere that I didn't feel like hunting across the entire game to find. I may end up playing the PSP version at some point in order to play the 'After Story' FF4.5 game that is included with that version.
The combat is classic FF action combat. Each character has a fixed job and roll within the party and gets their own time to shine throughout the story that really does a good job of fleshing out each character.
