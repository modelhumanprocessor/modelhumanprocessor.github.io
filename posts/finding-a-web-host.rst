.. description: using github pages
.. type: text

As alluded to in a previous post using a static site opens up some options for hosting such as github(or lab) pages. Which is what I'll be using. I'm not sure if that's in violation of their ToS, it doesn't seem to be. If a problem ever comes up I'll let future me deal with it. Luckily Nikola has support for using git pages built in so getting this to work hopefully won't be too painful.
Eventually I think it would be interesting to self host, but that's for another day.
