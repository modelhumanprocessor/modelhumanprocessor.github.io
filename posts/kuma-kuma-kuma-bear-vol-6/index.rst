.. description: Review for Kuma Bear vol 6
.. type: text

Yuna fulfils her promise from the previous volume. Escorting some students in the capitol. Of course there's some extra trouble involved to keep things interesting. After her friend from the seaside town arrives and everyone is busy getting the new shop ready. Closing out sets up the events for the next volume in looking for a new knife for Fina. As always anyone new who disparages the bear gets a lesson in judging a book by its cover.
