.. description: Lost in Blue(DS) Review
.. type: text

An island survival game that truly simulates the tedious drudgery of surviving on a deserted island after a shipwreck. You get to look after your fellow survivor and try to keep them alive by gathering enough food and water each day, and leading them around the island from time to time when you need their help to move a log or solve a puzzle that allows for deeper exploration of the island. Each day is the same, fetch water, gather food, explore and gather materials. It's like looking after a pair of tomogachi. Even though there's a map, there's no feature to make annotations of what supplies appear where so you can check back for when they respawn, and the overall movement speed just feels so slow after awhile and there's no setting to increase it. Eventually I gave up, the grind was just too much and unlike other grindy games where you always felt like you were making some progress, it was possible to make no progress while playing due to bad luck with food collection, or wasting time looking for some item that hadn't respawned, etc. The pacing just felt too slow and frustrating for me, which is too bad, because my initial impressions when starting the game were quite good and it felt like a novel game experience. I'm not sure if later titles in this series address any of my complaints or not, I hope they do.
