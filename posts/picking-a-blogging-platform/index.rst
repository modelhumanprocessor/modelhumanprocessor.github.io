.. description: Considerations of picking a blogging platform
.. type: text

Why I am not just using WordPress or one of the other more common blogging solutions? Cost certainly isn't a factor, most or all of them have free options available. Even being open source isn't a factor since WordPress is open source. I've opted for a SSG and Nikola in particular for a few reasons. 
1. to be a tiny bit contrarian
2. an SSG is a bit of an easier tool for me to wrap my head around what it's doing, especially with Nikola being written in Python, which I already am familiar with when compared to WordPress which is written in PHP and has way more features that at this time I do not feel the need to deal with. 
3. The appeal of a pure static HTML site over something that needs a database, which opens up some additional free hosting options.

Even if I change my mind later migrating from an SSG into some other platform should be relativeily straightforward, all the posts are just .rst files after all. (Hopefully those won't be infamous last words)
