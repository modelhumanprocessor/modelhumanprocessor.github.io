.. description: Pikmin and Pikmin 2 for GameCube review
.. type: text

A cute puzzle game released in 2001, and 2004 respectively for the Nintendo GameCube. Collect parts of your crashed ship with the help of cute flower creatures. Things start off great, but as the games progress the way the 'difficulty' ramps up is by means of making the levels larger and require more moving around navigating the pikmin to different areas. Which after the midpoint or so started to wear thin and be more tedious than anything else. Fun at first, the sound and music in particular, but just couldn't carry me through the entirity of either game.
