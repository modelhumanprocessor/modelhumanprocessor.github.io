.. description: What in the world is motivating me to enter the saturated blogging world?
.. type: text

Although it is amusing to entertain delusions of granduer that this site will somehow allow me to not have a day job and get invited too all of my favorite podcasts, that really isn't why I am making an attempt at establishing an online presence. Rather I wanted to create a place where I could dump my thoughts, ramblings, hobbies, and document learning about various technologies web related or otherwise. This is just a project I picked that would be the vehicle that will hopefully help me learn all these things. If I ever do figure out how monetization works, I'd be pretty satisfied if it covers the domain name registration and hosting costs.
